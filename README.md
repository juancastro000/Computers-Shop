# Computer Store Project

This is a simple learning exercise for managing a computer store inventory using Test-Driven Development (TDD). The project demonstrates how to incrementally implement functionality using Java 21, JUnit 5, and Hamcrest.

## Description

The goal of this project is to build a simple Computer Store application step by step using TDD. Initially, we write tests for each functionality and then implement only the code needed to pass those tests. The key functionalities include:

- Adding a computer to the store.
- Deleting a computer from the store.
- Searching for a computer by brand.
- Listing all computers in the store.

## Technologies Used

- **Java 21**
- **JUnit 5** for unit testing.
- **Hamcrest** for writing expressive assertions.
- An **in-memory repository** to simulate data persistence.
